This program cannot work without the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from google drive: https://drive.google.com/a/columbia.edu/folderview?id=0B8rBV_jIjBukNEJnMlZsd25ncVU&usp=sharing (only lionmail can access)
with three data file: set0.txt, set1.txt and set2.txt into the directory /data
Note that: the program works well on Mac (involves the usage of Shell script. We cannot guarantee that it works well on Linux).
